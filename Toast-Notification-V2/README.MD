A project from Brad Traversy's 50 Projects in 50 Days

V1: a message appears when an event triggers and then disappears after a couple of seconds(using setTimeout and Elem.remove()).

V2: the message features a close button which makes it disappear when clicked.

Multiple messages can appear and stack on top of each other.
